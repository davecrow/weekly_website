			<h4><span id="ltitle">About me</span></h4>
			<p>
				I am a former history teacher with my sights set on becoming a web developer. To that end, I will be attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> in the summer.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not writing code, you can find me playing my mandolin, building electric guitars, or chasing my 2 year old daughter around the house. I love maps, single-malt scotch, audiobooks. I <i>really love</i> the Fighting Illini, my family, and classical music, although not necessarily in that order.
			</p>
			<p>Finally, I'm a maker. I love to create and build. I always have. This is what drew me to web development in the first place. Whether the medium is wood, music, Legos, or code; I'm happiest when I'm creating something that challenges me.</p>

			<h4><span id="rtitle">About this project</span></h4>
			<p>
				For most of the year I've been teaching myself to code. I have mostly been using tutorial-based online resources like <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a>, or challenge-based tools like <a href="http://codewars.com">Code Wars</a>. Those sites are great, but there's a limit to how useful they are. I'm not aware of any great market demand for tutorial-completers. I was getting good and tutorials but still not good at making anything useful. My learning was moving too slowly.
			</p>
			<p>
				I decided I needed to adopt the JFDI method and actually build something. I have been kicking a few ideas around in my head for far too long and it's time I try them out. I have a few simple rules for myself:
				<ul>
					<li>Complete (and release) one new website every week.</li>
					<li>Learn and use a new skill with each weekly website.</li>
					<li>Document what I learn in a weekly blog.</li>
					<li>Every site should be useful.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				That's it. When I head to Chicago in June, I will have 24 websites under my belt. You can follow my progress here and on my blog. Thanks for stopping by!
